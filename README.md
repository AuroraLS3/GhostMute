# GhostMute

This is the plugin repository for [Ghostmute](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/ghostmute-fake-blocked-messages.33880/). 
Ghostmute attempts to fake messages sent by muted players by sending the muted player the message, while blocking it from being seen.

Due to lack of personal interest this project has been discontinued and archived.
